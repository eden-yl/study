What is an API and How Does it Work? APIs for Beginners


freecodecamp
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary, allowing different systems to exchange data and functionality in a standardized way.

Think of an API as a messenger between different systems. Imagine you're at a restaurant and you want to order food. You can't just walk into the kitchen and start making your own food because you don't have the skills or access. Instead, you give your order to the waiter, who takes it to the kitchen staff. They then prepare your food according to your request, and the waiter brings it back to you.

In this scenario, the waiter is like an API. You (the customer) are the client, and the kitchen staff (the system) is the provider. The waiter (API) takes your request, communicates it to the kitchen staff, and brings back the response (your food).

Here's a brief summary of API:

Key characteristics:

Standardization: APIs follow a set of rules and protocols to ensure seamless communication.
Abstraction: APIs hide the complexity of the underlying system, making it easier to interact with.
Interface: APIs provide a clear interface for clients to interact with the system.
Types of APIs:

Web API: Used for web-based interactions, such as web services or web applications.
Operating system API: Used for interactions between the operating system and applications.
Library API: Used for interactions between libraries and applications.
API requests:

GET: Retrieve data from the system.
POST: Send data to the system to create or update.
PUT: Update existing data in the system.
DELETE: Delete data from the system.
This is just a brief overview, but I hope it helps you understand the basics of APIs! Do you have any specific questions or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
